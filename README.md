# personalsite2.0

My personal site for the DALI Developer Challenge!

This is my take on a personal website with some variety in how the information about myself is presented. While I've worked on static sites, as seen in my coding samples, I thought it would be more fun to create an engaging way for someone to navigate the site and learn more about me!
